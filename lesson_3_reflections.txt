REFLECTION: Using a Remote Repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use remote repository when I want to share my work with other people, for example, 
when I collaborate on a project with others.

REFLECTION: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stayup-to-date with you remote repository?

Sometimes you don't want to make things public while you are still working on them.

REFLECTION: Forks, Clones and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forking is cloning another person's repository on GitHub to your new repository on GitHab. You usually clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine or from local machine to local machine. Branches exist within the repository and they are used for exploring/trying different directions in the development of a project. 

REFLECTION: Local Copies of the Remote Branches
What is the benefit of the last copy of the remote stored locally?

The benefit might be that it you are going to work off-line for some time, you will have the access
to the most up-to-date information about the remote. Also you will be able to merge remote branch into your local branch.
